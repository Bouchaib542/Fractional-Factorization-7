# Guided Fractional Biprime Factorization

This project implements a guided fractional method for factoring biprime numbers using specific decimal guides (e.g., 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625).

- âœ… Works for biprimes up to ~10^8 on mobile devices.
- ðŸ“„ Based on the research of Bahbouhi Bouchaib.

This method identifies prime factors of biprime numbers by dividing the input by specific decimal values and applying binary scaling.
